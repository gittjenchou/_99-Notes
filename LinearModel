As illustrated in img:LinearModelLeadToGradientDescent, these are some points for key highlights:
  1. One has to notice that there is constant on w, the weight or coefficient
  2. The 2nd line expresses the derivative of the 1st line in order to find its solution
  3. The last line contains inverse of matrix which could imply to huge computation
  4. This leads to gradient descent in order to find the solution instead computing it.
