NONLINEAR REGRESSION PROCEDURE 
implements iterative methods that attempt to find least-squares estimates for nonlinear models.
The default method is Gauss-Newton, although several other methods, such as Newton and Marquardt, are available.
You must specify parameter names, starting values, and expressions for the model.
Grid search is also available to select starting values for the parameters. 
Since nonlinear models are often difficult to estimate, PROC NLIN may not always find the globally optimal least-squares estimates
