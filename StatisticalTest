PAIRED TEST
when observation in a test is related to to observation in other test, then it's paired
e.g. before after training, check improvement of driving skill by measuring driving errors
usually instead of the difference of sample mean, we derive one variable, diff of attr 1 to attr 2, and test that statistics

population  --> sample (the distribution of sample is called sample distribution)
statistics  --> sample statistics (the distribution of sample statistics is called sampling distribution)
Central Limit Theorem speaks about sampling distribution, normally distributed across mean population and spreading by population sdev/sqrt(n)
This spread of sampling dist is called standard error, with most of the case population sdev is replaced by sample sdev
Conditions that should be met for CLT:
-- sampled obsv must be independent, and to make sure this cond obtained, do random sampling and take less than 10% of population
-- when taking more than 10% sample, chance is higher to take independent obsvs
-- sample size more than 30
And because of sampling distribution is normal, we can speak about 68%, 95%, and 99% interval that contains its mean, which is population mean.
This becomes the idea for confidence interval.
Remember that we have point estimate, which is our sample statistics mean, and from this we can talk about interval that contains population mean.
This means, for different sample, we have diff point estimate, and diff conf.interval.
Therefore don't think that conf.interval is rigid, it contains something, does not mean that it should be between certain lower and upper bound.
There is no certain thing when estimating population from sample.
When specifiying 1.96*sample sdev/sqrt(n), we actually speak about margin of error.
The same concept can be applied to other estimator, as long as it meets the condition which is the distr of sampling distribution is normal.
Proven estimator with normal sampling distr are:
-- sample mean
-- diff of sample mean
-- sample proportion
-- diff of sample proportion
Remember that 0.05 significance level is complementary to 95% confidence level.
Only have to be cautious with one-tailed or two-tailed concept. CL = 1-alpha for two--tailed and CL = 1-2alpha for one-tailed
For one tailed is multipled with two as confidence interval spacing out left and right extreme interval. 
type I error    :   reject null hypo when it's true
type II error   :   reject alt hypo when it's true


COCHRAN–MANTEL–HAENSZEL TEST
-- usage                :   test when you have data from 2×2 tables that you've repeated at different times or locations. 
--                      :   It will tell you whether you have a consistent difference in proportions across the repeats.
-- The null hypothesis  :   the relative proportions of one variable are independent of the other variable within the repeats
--                      :   in other words, there is no consistent difference in proportions in the 2×2 tables.
-- case example         :   the null hypothesis would be that the proportion of people feeling pain 
--                          was the same for legwarmer-wearers and non-legwarmer wearers, across winter and summer data (test).
-- keyword              :   2x2 comparison across different sample data (different test)


FISHER'S EXACT TEST
-- usage                :   when you have two nominal variables. 
--                      :   You want to know whether the proportions for one variable are different among values of the other variable. 
-- notes                :   Fisher's exact test is more accurate than the chi-square test or G–test of independence 
--                          when the expected numbers are small, e.gh. the total sample size is less than 1000
-- The null hypothesis  :   the relative proportions of one variable are independent of the second variable
--                      :   in other words, the proportions at one variable are the same for different values of the second variable
-- keyword              :   2x2 comparison across different sample data (different test)


MCNEMAR'S TEST
-- consider             :   2x2 contigency table
--                      :                       test #02 positive       test #02 negative
--                      : test #01 positive                     a                       b
--                      : test #02 negative                     c                       d
-- The null hypothesis  :   Ho : pb = pc (pa + pb = pa + pc and pc + pd = pb + pd)
